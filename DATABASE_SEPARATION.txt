========================================
DATABASE SEPARATION EXPLAINED
========================================

YES! Your data is completely separate!

========================================
HOW IT WORKS:
========================================

PostgreSQL uses TABLES to separate data.

Your LoveWaving app creates these tables:
- User
- Account
- Session
- Event
- Waiver
- WaiverSignature
- UserSignature
- VerificationToken

Your other application has different tables.

They DON'T interact or conflict!

========================================
VISUAL EXAMPLE:
========================================

Your PostgreSQL database has:

[Table: products]          <- Other app
[Table: orders]            <- Other app
[Table: users]             <- Other app
[Table: User]              <- LoveWaving ✨
[Table: Account]           <- LoveWaving ✨
[Table: Event]             <- LoveWaving ✨
[Table: Waiver]            <- LoveWaving ✨
[Table: WaiverSignature]   <- LoveWaving ✨
[Table: UserSignature]     <- LoveWaving ✨
[Table: VerificationToken] <- LoveWaving ✨

Completely separate!

========================================
IS IT SAFE?
========================================

✅ YES! Absolutely safe!

- Each app has different tables
- No data mixing
- No conflicts
- Both apps work independently

========================================
FUTURE MIGRATIONS:
========================================

When you run migrations:

npm run db:migrate

Prisma ONLY touches LoveWaving tables.
It won't affect your other app's tables!

========================================
WHAT IF TABLE NAMES MATCH?
========================================

If you have a "User" table in both apps:
- Rename it in Prisma schema
- Change "User" to "LoveWavingUser"
- Run migration

========================================
RECOMMENDATION:
========================================

You can use the SAME PostgreSQL database!

Benefits:
✅ Save money (one database)
✅ Easy to manage
✅ Data stays separate
✅ Both apps work fine

========================================
NEED COMPLETE SEPARATION?
========================================

If you want separate databases:
1. Create new PostgreSQL on Render
2. Use different DATABASE_URL
3. Now completely isolated

But you DON'T need to! Separate tables is enough.
