========================================
READY TO COMPLETE FEATURES
========================================

I've added QR code libraries to package.json!

You need to run this locally:
  npm install

Then push to GitHub and deploy.

========================================
WHAT'S NEXT:
========================================

After you do npm install, I'll add:
1. QR code generation on event detail page
2. Public join flow via QR code
3. Email notifications
4. CSV export
5. Waiver update notifications

This is a big feature set! Let me know when you've run npm install.
