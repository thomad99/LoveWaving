========================================
SIGN OUT BUTTON FIXED
========================================

The sign out button was hanging because it was trying to use /api/auth/signout as a page route.

========================================
WHAT I FIXED:
========================================

Created a proper SignOutButton component that:
- Uses NextAuth's signOut() client function
- Properly handles redirect
- Works on both dashboard and admin pages

========================================
DEPLOYED:
========================================

Pushed to GitHub, Render will auto-deploy.

The Server Action error is still blocking though!

You still need to fix the build command in Render.

Follow FIX_BUILD_NOW.txt to fix it.
