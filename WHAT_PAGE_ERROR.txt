========================================
WHERE IS THE ERROR?
========================================

The server action error is blocking everything!

Need to know:
1. Which page shows the error?
2. Landing page (/)?
3. Admin dashboard (/admin)?
4. Sign in page (/auth/signin)?

========================================
ALSO CHECK:
========================================

Render build logs - did npm install work?
Look for these lines:
  ✓ Installed qrcode
  ✓ Installed react-qr-code

If you see errors during install, that's the problem!

========================================
NEXT STEPS:
========================================

Tell me:
1. Which page has the error
2. Any npm install errors in build logs

Then I'll fix it!
