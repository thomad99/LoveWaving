========================================
CRITICAL: DATABASE TABLES NOT CREATED
========================================

Your database has NO TABLES!

The migration command is NOT running during builds.

========================================
THE PROBLEM:
========================================

Render builds the app but SKIPS running:
  prisma db push

This means tables are never created!

========================================
SOLUTION: MANUAL MIGRATION
========================================

Since you can't run commands in Render Shell,
we need a DIFFERENT approach:

OPTION 1: Update Render Build Command in Dashboard
---------------------------------------------------

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click your service: lovewaving
3. Go to Settings
4. Find "Build Command"
5. Change it to:
   
   npm install && npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push && npm run build

6. Save
7. Click "Manual Deploy"
8. Click "Deploy latest commit"

This SHOULD create the tables!

========================================
OPTION 2: Create Migration Files
---------------------------------------------------

Use prisma migrate instead of db push
(More complex but better for production)

========================================
WHAT TO TELL ME:
========================================

Go to Render Dashboard → Settings → Build Command

What does it currently say?

Share it with me and I'll tell you exactly how to fix it!
