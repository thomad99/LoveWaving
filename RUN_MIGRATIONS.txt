URGENT: Run Database Migrations
========================================

Your database tables don't exist yet!

========================================
SOLUTION: Run Migrations in Render
========================================

Method 1: Via Render Shell (RECOMMENDED)
----------------------------------------

1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your Web Service
2. Click "Shell" tab on the left
3. Connect to shell
4. Run this command:

npx prisma migrate deploy

OR

npx prisma db push

Then your tables will be created!

========================================
Method 2: Via Render Dashboard
----------------------------------------

1. Go to your service → Manual Deploy
2. This will rebuild and run migrations
   (if configured in build command)

========================================
Method 3: Update Build Command
----------------------------------------

In Render Dashboard → Your Service → Settings:

Change build command to:
npm install && npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate deploy && npm run build

Then trigger a new deploy!

========================================
WHAT TO EXPECT:
========================================

After running migrations, you'll see:
- ✓ User table created
- ✓ Event table created
- ✓ Waiver table created
- ✓ All other tables created

Then the app will work!

========================================
VERIFY:
========================================

After migrations run successfully:

1. Visit your app
2. Try to sign up
3. Should work!
