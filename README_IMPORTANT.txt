========================================
IMPORTANT - READ THIS
========================================

I CANNOT run Git commands on your computer!

Every time I fix files, YOU must run:

    FIX_ALL_CONFLICTS.bat

This is the ONLY way to push changes to GitHub.

========================================
WHY?
========================================

Git needs YOUR credentials (username, password/token).

I can only:
- Fix your code files
- Show you what to do

You must:
- Run the batch file
- Push to GitHub

========================================
WHAT TO DO NOW:
========================================

Double-click: FIX_ALL_CONFLICTS.bat

That's it! Then Render will build.

========================================
FOR THE FUTURE:
========================================

Every time you see files change in this chat:

1. I'll fix them
2. You run FIX_ALL_CONFLICTS.bat
3. Render builds

OR use GitHub Desktop (easier):
https://desktop.github.com/
