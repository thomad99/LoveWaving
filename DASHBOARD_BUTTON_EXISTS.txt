========================================
BUTTON IS THERE!
========================================

The "Create Event" button exists in the code at line 84-89.

========================================
WHY YOU DON'T SEE IT:
========================================

The Server Action error is blocking pages from loading!

Until we fix the build, you can't see anything.

========================================
ONCE BUILD IS FIXED:
========================================

1. Sign in as admin
2. You'll see Admin Dashboard
3. "Create Event" button is on the right
4. Below the stats cards

========================================
SUMMARY:
========================================

The button exists, code is there.
The deployment just needs to work first!

Follow FIX_BUILD_NOW.txt to fix the deployment.
