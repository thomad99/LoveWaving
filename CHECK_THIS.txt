========================================
CHECK YOUR GITHUB NOW
========================================

Go to: https://github.com/thomad99/LoveWaving

Look for the prisma folder!

You should see:
https://github.com/thomad99/LoveWaving/tree/main/prisma

Inside prisma folder, you should see:
- schema.prisma

IF YOU DON'T SEE THESE, YOUR FILES WEREN'T UPLOADED!

========================================
WHAT TO DO IF FILES ARE MISSING
========================================

Option 1: Use GitHub Desktop
----------------------------
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Add the LoveWaving folder if not already there
3. You'll see ALL your files on the left
4. Make sure prisma/ folder is there
5. Commit and push

Option 2: Use sync.bat
----------------------
1. Double-click sync.bat
2. It will upload ALL files
3. Then check GitHub again

========================================
VERIFY ALL THESE FOLDERS EXIST ON GITHUB
========================================

Go to GitHub and check for:
✓ app/
✓ components/
✓ lib/
✓ prisma/  ← THIS IS THE IMPORTANT ONE!
✓ package.json
✓ render.yaml

If any are missing, your upload didn't work!
