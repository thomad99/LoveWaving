HOW TO USE YOUR GITHUB TOKEN
========================================

After you create a NEW token (after revoking the old one):

========================================
STEP 1: Get NEW Token
========================================
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Create NEW token
3. Copy it (starts with ghp_)
4. Save it somewhere SAFE

========================================
STEP 2: Use sync.bat
========================================
1. Double-click: sync.bat in your project folder
2. It will run and ask for credentials
3. When asked for USERNAME: thomad99
4. When asked for PASSWORD: PASTE YOUR NEW TOKEN
5. Press Enter

========================================
OR: Use GitHub Desktop (EASIER!)
========================================
1. Download: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Install and open
3. Sign in with your GitHub account
4. File → Add Local Repository
5. Select your LoveWaving folder
6. Click "Publish repository"
7. DONE! (No token needed!)

========================================
WHAT IS THE TOKEN?
========================================

The token is a PASSWORD substitute for Git.

Instead of using your real GitHub password, you use this token.

It's like a special key that Git uses to authenticate you.

========================================
REMEMBER:
========================================

✅ Token = Your password for Git commands
✅ Keep it SECRET (don't share!)
✅ If you shared it, create a new one
✅ GitHub Desktop doesn't need tokens

========================================
