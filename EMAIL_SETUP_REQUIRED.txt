EMAIL SETUP REQUIRED 📧
========================================

To enable email notifications, you need:

========================================
OPTIONS:
========================================

OPTION 1: SMTP Server (Recommended for production)
---------------------------------------
You'll need an SMTP service provider:

Popular Options:
1. SendGrid (Free: 100 emails/day)
2. Mailgun (Free: 5,000 emails/month)
3. AWS SES (Pay-as-you-go, very cheap)
4. Postmark (Free: 100 emails/month)
5. Your own SMTP server

What I need from you:
- SMTP_HOST (e.g., smtp.sendgrid.net)
- SMTP_PORT (e.g., 587)
- SMTP_USER (your username)
- SMTP_PASSWORD (your password)
- SMTP_FROM (e.g., noreply@lovewaving.com)

========================================
OPTION 2: Gmail (Good for testing)
---------------------------------------
You can use your Gmail account for testing:

What I need:
- GMAIL_USER (your email)
- GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD (generate in Google Account settings)

Note: Requires "App Password" enabled in Google Account

========================================
WHAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED:

1. Email to User when they sign waiver
   - Includes copy of signed document
   - Event details
   - Timestamp

2. Email to Event Organizer when someone signs
   - Who signed
   - When they signed
   - Link to view the signed document

3. Email when waiver is updated
   - Notifies existing signers to re-sign
   - Link to re-sign

========================================
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
========================================

I will add:
- nodemailer package
- Email templates
- Email service utility
- API routes for sending
- Configuration in env.example

========================================
