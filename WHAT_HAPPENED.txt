WHY SYNC DIDN'T ASK FOR TOKEN
========================================

Possibilities:

1. Git already has your credentials saved
   - Git credential manager might have your old password
   - It's using cached credentials

2. First commands succeeded, but push failed
   - init, add, commit worked
   - Push failed (but didn't ask for password)

3. Windows Credential Manager has old credentials

========================================
SOLUTIONS
========================================

Option 1: Clear old credentials
-------------------------------
1. Search Windows for "Credential Manager"
2. Open "Windows Credential Manager"
3. Find "git:https://github.com"
4. Delete it
5. Run sync.bat again

Option 2: Check what actually ran
----------------------------------
Look at the sync.bat output:
- Did it say "Success" or "Push Failed"?
- Did it create a commit?
- What was the last message?

Option 3: Use GitHub Desktop
-----------------------------
Just use GitHub Desktop - it's easier!
https://desktop.github.com/

========================================
CHECK YOUR GITHUB NOW
========================================

Go to: https://github.com/thomad99/LoveWaving

Are your files there?

YES → Success! You're done!
NO → Need to push (continue below)

========================================
IF FILES ARE NOT ON GITHUB
========================================

Try this:

1. Open PowerShell in your project folder
2. Run: git status
3. See what it says
4. If files are ready, run: git push -u origin main

That should ask for your token!
