========================================
VIEW DOCUMENTS & PDF UPLOAD COMPLETE ✅
========================================

Added ability to view signed documents and upload PDF waivers!

========================================
WHAT WAS ADDED:
========================================

1. VIEW SIGNED WAIVERS ✅
   - "View Document" button on admin event details page
   - Opens signed PDF in new tab
   - Uses secure S3 signed URLs (1 hour expiry)
   - Only admins can view

2. PDF UPLOAD FUNCTIONALITY ✅
   - Admin can upload PDF/DOC when creating event
   - Files stored in S3 bucket (public-read)
   - Displayed in iframe on sign page
   - Falls back to text content if no PDF

========================================
HOW IT WORKS:
========================================

ADMIN SIDE:
1. Admin uploads PDF when creating event
2. PDF stored in S3: waivers/{eventId}/{filename}
3. Public URL saved in database
4. Users see PDF in iframe when signing

USER SIDE:
1. User clicks to sign waiver
2. Sees PDF document in iframe
3. Enters signature below
4. Submits to complete

VIEW SIGNED DOCS:
1. Admin goes to event details
2. Clicks "View Document" for a signature
3. Gets temporary S3 URL
4. Opens PDF in browser

========================================
FILES CREATED/UPDATED:
========================================

New:
- app/api/admin/signed-waivers/[id]/route.ts
  * Generates S3 signed URLs for viewing documents

- components/admin/view-document-button.tsx
  * Client component for viewing documents

========================================
TECHNICAL DETAILS:
========================================

Waiver PDFs:
- Stored as: waivers/{eventId}/{filename}.pdf
- ACL: public-read (viewable by all)
- Format: application/pdf

Signed Waivers:
- Stored as: signed-waivers/{eventId}/{userId}/{sigId}.pdf
- ACL: private (admin only)
- URL: Temporary signed URL (1 hour)

========================================
NEXT: FORM FIELD PARSING
========================================

Now that PDFs are displayed, we need to:
1. Parse PDFs to detect form fields
2. Map to standard fields
3. Build smart form UI

Ready to continue when you are!
