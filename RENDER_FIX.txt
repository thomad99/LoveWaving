FIX FOR RENDER BUILD ERROR
========================================

The issue is that your Prisma schema file wasn't uploaded to GitHub.

========================================
SOLUTION STEPS
========================================

1. Make sure prisma/schema.prisma is uploaded to GitHub
   - Check: https://github.com/thomad99/LoveWaving/tree/main/prisma
   - You should see schema.prisma file there

2. If prisma folder is missing on GitHub:
   - Use GitHub Desktop to add the files
   - Or use the sync.bat script
   - Make sure you commit and push ALL files

3. Update Render Build Command to be more explicit:

   Current (in Render dashboard):
   npm install && npx prisma generate && npm run build

   Change to:
   npm install && npx prisma generate --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma && npm run build

4. Trigger a new deployment in Render

========================================
ALTERNATIVE: VERIFY FILES ON GITHUB
========================================

Go to: https://github.com/thomad99/LoveWaving

You MUST see these files:
✓ prisma/schema.prisma
✓ package.json
✓ app/ folder
✓ components/ folder
✓ lib/ folder

If ANY are missing, they weren't pushed to GitHub!

========================================
IF STILL NOT WORKING
========================================

Try this build command instead:

npm install && npx prisma generate --schema=prisma/schema.prisma && npm run build

OR completely remove prisma generate from build (not recommended):

npm install && npm run build

But then you'll need to run prisma generate manually in Render shell.
